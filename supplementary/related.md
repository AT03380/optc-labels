## Analyzing the Usefulness of the DARPA OpTC Dataset in Cyber Threat Detection Research

[This short article](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450569.3463573) is an early attempt to document the OpTC dataset.  It is complementary to our work and provides useful analysis.

## Labels for OpTC dataset host-based events

The authors of the above article have published their own [set of OpTC labels](https://gist.github.com/hamelin/7e1f2be6f2d6f9f645de60f73bd45b1a). These labels were used for the evaluation of several SOTA methods in the literature.

In contrast to our own method presented in this work, their labelling process is entirely manual and lacks a documented methodology. However, both sets of labels can be used for cross-validation.
