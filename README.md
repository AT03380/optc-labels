# Effective IDS under constraints of modern enterprise networks: revisiting the OpTC dataset

Article repository.

### Abstract

The lack of high-quality public datasets is a major obstacle for the creation
of practical and effective intrusion detection systems.  Hundreds of new
publications dedicated to this topic are released every year, but the majority
of researchers have to rely on industry partners to get access to proprietary
datasets, or use a handful of _traditional_ synthetic datasets, such as KDD99
or CIC-IDS2017.  Due to their age, simplicity and represented attacks, these
datasets cannot contribute to the detection of intrusions in modern
environments.  At the same time, newer, advanced datasets, such as OpTC, have
been almost entirely ignored by the scientific community.  Due to the enormous
volume and almost complete lack of documentation, only few authors were able to
leverage it for the evaluation of their IDS designs.  In this work, we aim to
make the OpTC dataset more accessible for modern IDS research by pointing out
methodology flaws in prior art, designing a repeatable and documented labeling
process, and building the baseline of the environment.
